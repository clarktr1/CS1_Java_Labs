## How to get started
The first thing you will need is an Integerated Development Environment (IDE). There are several to choose from. With the simplicity of these labs, I highly recommend using [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org/). It is lightway and extremely easy to set up and use. The labs will start with "Open BlueJ". If you choose to use a different IDE, ignore the step. 
Please look at the [documentation](https://www.bluej.org/doc/documentation.html) for help with learning how to use BlueJ.

## Contributions
Thanks to the staff and students of Frisco ISD for allowing me to use and create learning material. ALl of this would not be possible without the collarboation and mentorship of my peers. Labs included in this repo are collaborations as well as original content.
